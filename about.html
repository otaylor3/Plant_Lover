            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Gold Lite was started by Bree because she brings Lite to all situations. The natural light 
                is the best light, but after that light there is Gold Lite. Focused on nature and preserving 
                the beauty all around us. Gold Lite is all about positivity and spreading love through loving plants 
                and teaching others how to love plants. Gold Lite names all of her plants, because they are her friends, 
                and each one has a different personality and she treats each one differently. She loves her plants and is 
                always looking to get more friends and share her friends with the world around her.
